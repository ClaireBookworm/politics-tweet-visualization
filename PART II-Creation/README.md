# Politics Tweet Visualization

We all love politicians. And we especially love their tweets. So, why don't we analyze which politicians are very active and their demographics? We used the [Twitter Politics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/us-politicians-twitter-dataset/version/1). This is part 2 of this three part project.

> This was a fun visualization using the ideas of right and left wing to help describe the categores of data! 

## Texture

> Here it was fun to use texture a little more abtractly, not using it to represent specific values, but reather using a collective 3D texture to dispaly trends of the data. Althouhg unfortunatley there seems to be no understandable pattern differntiating the number of twitter acounts x age between democrats, republicans, and other pollitical parties.

## Size

>I had a fun time coming up with how to best use size in a "non-cliche" way, and so I eventually decided to have it both describe the age with the most twitter accounts associated with it, and the number of politicians of a political party in that group. It is just a touch odd, but it was fun regardless hah :)

## Position

> Of course, the United States had leagues of more politicians on twitter than any other country, with 2,366 in our dataset (with, of course, many more not in the dataset). So, I deleted the that datapoint so the scale was less skewed, which lead us to this graph! Surprisingly, the second most was Germnay!

## Color
