# Politics Tweet Visualization

We all love politicians. And we especially love their tweets. So, why don't we analyze which politicians are very active and their demographics? We used the [Twitter Politics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/us-politicians-twitter-dataset/version/1). This is part 2 of this three part project.

> Of course, the United States had leagues of more politicians on twitter than any other country, with 2,366 in our dataset (with, of course, many more not in the dataset). So, I deleted the that datapoint so the scale was less skewed, which lead us to this graph! Surprisingly, the second most was Germnay!
